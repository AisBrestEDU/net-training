###Test task:
Please implement AsyncIO\Tests.cs

It is easy to solve this task using NET 4.5 and new async-await feature.

So, if you want to switch to NET 4.5 please make sure you have it installed, open project properties and select **Target Framework** as **.NET Framework 4.5** for both projects.
In this case please add **async** keyword to any task method you found it reasonable.

It is also possible to solve these tasks using NET 4.0 but it is a bit more complex and sophisticated.


###NOTE:
1. Use can see the debug information during test if Ð¾pen Output window select output from "Debug". Hope it helps you understand the request-response flow. It works in Debug mode only.
2. Please check the performance of **GetUrlContent** against **GetUrlContentAsync**
